title: "Stirge spawn"
---
Stirges fly down from between the stalactites in the cave roof.

| Round | Roll | Range | Average |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | 4d4 / 2 | 2-8 | 5 |
| 2+ | 3d4 / 2 | 2-6 | 4 |

The pcs roll a d6 each and the 2 lowest get attacked by half the spawn each, if it's more than 3 the overflow goes to the next lowest roll.
