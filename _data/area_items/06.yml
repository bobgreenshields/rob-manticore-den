  desc: |-
    There are a number of rockfalls in the hall

- title: "High ceiling"
  desc: |-
    The ceiling is about 40ft high and is the original cave ceiling.  It is covered in stalactities, hollows and the occasional small tunnel.

- title: "Movement above"
  desc: |-
    Movement can be heard from the ceiling.  The shadows are deep amongst the stalactites and hollows but movement can be seen.  Only short snatches of small movements but there is definitely something up there.

- title: "Piles of armour and weapons"
  desc: |-
    Scattered piles of metal helmets, armour and weapons along with sundry other metal items.

- title: "A blocked staircase"
  desc: |-
    Rockfall has blocked the staircase to the east.  However on investigation the rocks do not quite fill the space and if the top few were moved an opening could be created.  Requires 4 successful DC18 Str checks or success if time not an issue.  A space big enough for a medium creature to wriggle through will then be opened up.  The doors at the top of the stairs are closed.
